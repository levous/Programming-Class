#### The Little Bang

# Set Up Your Environment #
===============
## Operating System (OS) ##
It's up to you!  Most programmers that I know prefer MacOS but unless you want to build iPhone apps, any modern OS will work equally well.  It's helpful to keep your Operating System updated.  

## Shell ##
**Bash Shell**:  A simple program that allows you to type commands in text and run them on your machine (computer).  It's already on Mac or Linux.  Here's how to [Install on Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

## Tools ##

### Code Editor ###
**Atom**: *super-fancy* text editor allows you to edit code files.  You will eventually be told that you aren't a real programmer unless you edit code using VIM.  Don't fall for it.

[Download and install Atom](https://atom.io)

### Code Repository ###
**git**: stores the life history of every change, by every person, on every file in your codebase and copies that entire history to the cloud.  With it you can make changes to a text file simultaneously with any number of other programmers, look back in time to see how the code used to work (or not work), and make bold, ruthless changes following completely different thought processes, strategies or areas of focus, and magically merge all or pieces of it together at any future date.  Wondering how it accomplishes this makes my brain hurt.

[Download and install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Choose your OS under the *Downloads* heading.
Ignore that bit explaining, "...you can get the latest development version via Git itself."  They're just showing off!
